## Why create Inkdown?

We hope to enable knowledge creators such as geeks, authors, and teachers etc, have their own document websites without the need for servers or technical knowledge. Provide the most user-friendly and readable Markdown editor, addressing many of the shortcomings of traditional Markdown. Using standard Markdown as a carrier allows your document content to be easily moved out or in at any time, and Inkdown is just one of your options.



## Regarding your privacy

After you register, Inkdown will not send you any marketing emails, and your information will not be used in any scenario other than your own recording and publishing. Inkdown only exists as a tool.



## Why is Inkdown so fast?

Inkdown uses modern browser databases as cache, so there is no need to request servers when opening and searching, its user experience is consistent with offline software. But Inkdown will compare the changes made to the file and synchronize the modified parts to ensure consistency in the content across multiple ends. So Inkdown can even run offline, comparing and synchronizing during network recovery.



## How can you use your document elsewhere?

Markdown, as a universal format, is supported in most content platforms, while Inkdown uses the `GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec`, and exported content can be used anywhere. And provide the function of copying Markdown code, exporting all files in the workspace, or real-time writing to a local folder, allowing you to have your own standard Markdown copy locally at any time.



## Price

Inkdown offers a free trial, and if you don't record documents on a large scale or use publishing, the free amount is sufficient for your use. Plus accounts are also very cheap. If you want to publish your documents without restrictions or generate your own document website, you can consider a Plus account.



## After the Plus account expires

After the Plus account expires, you can still export your documents for migration with just one click. We will save your data for 6 months. During this period, if you do not open a Plus account again, you will not be able to save new content and published documents will not be viewed. When you open a Plus account again, everything will be restored.
