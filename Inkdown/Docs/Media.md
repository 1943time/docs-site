You can insert local or network images, or use `Media Link` to insert network media. When selecting media, there is a slider below the element to adjust the element size. When double clicking on the image, it will restore the default height.

Media link also supports embedding in web pages. It should be noted that some network resources are prohibited from being referenced by third parties.
