## Suspension Rights

We reserve the right to immediately terminate the Services if: (i) the billing or contact information provided by you is false or fraudulent; or (ii) you fail to make any payment due within ten business days after we have provided you with notice of such failure. Any suspension of the Services by us under this section shall not relieve you of your payment obligations under this Agreement. We will not be liable to you nor to any third party for any suspension of the Services resulting from your non-payment of fees.

## Security

We provide these services from the data center facilities, and users can access these facilities remotely through the Internet, combined with some offline components we provide according to this agreement. We may occasionally use third-party service providers to provide limited service portions, including data storage and processing, and you agree that we will subcontract these services to these third parties. We implement security programs to help protect your data from security attacks. However, you understand that using the service inevitably involves transmitting your customer data through networks that are not owned, operated or controlled by us, and we are not responsible for any loss, alteration, interception, copying, or storage of your customer data on these networks. We cannot guarantee that our security program will not go wrong, the transmission of your customer data will always be secure, or unauthorized third parties will never be able to disrupt our security measures or the security measures of our third-party service providers. If you discover any security vulnerabilities in the service, you agree to notify us immediately.

## Networks

The technical processing and transmission of services may involve: (i) transmission through various networks; And/or (ii) modifications made to meet and adapt to the technical requirements of the connected network or device. Using or connecting to the Internet provides unauthorized personnel with the opportunity to bypass security precautions and illegally access services, customer data, or customer content. We do not guarantee the privacy, security or authenticity of any content, data or information transmitted or stored through any system connected to the Internet.

## Fees

You agree to pay all fees set out in an Access Agreement. All fees are non-cancellable and non-refundable and are based on Services purchased and not actual usage. Unless otherwise agreed between you and us, charges may be paid by credit card, electronic funds transfer or bank/wire transfer. For the avoidance of doubt, you shall not be entitled to any refund in the event of unused Services.

## Maintenance and repair

We use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that availability of the Services will be uninterrupted and that transmissions will be error-free. However, due to the nature of the internet, this cannot be guaranteed. Also, your access to Services may be occasionally suspended or restricted to allow for repairs, maintenance or the introduction of new facilities or services. We will attempt to limit the frequency and duration of any such suspension or restriction, and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to alert or notify you in the event of any scheduled or non-scheduled suspension of Services. Due to the nature of technical outages, we cannot guarantee notice prior to unplanned outages. We will not be held responsible for any delay or failure to comply with our obligations under these conditions if the delay or failure arises from any cause which is beyond our reasonable control.

## Disclaimers

We do not guarantee the absolute security of data, and we are not responsible for data loss caused by force majeure (natural disasters, etc.). The software provides a timely backup function, and using it reasonably to backup ensures the security of your data.

Inkdown is not responsible for any direct or indirect losses, damages, or disputes, including but not limited to data loss, loss of profits, loss of goodwill, etc.
