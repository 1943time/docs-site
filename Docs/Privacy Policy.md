By default, all content you place in your own space in Inkdown is private. We will not attempt to make money from your content.

There are some features in Inkdown that allow you to publish and share some of your content with others, but these features are completely optional and whether to use them depends on yourself.

The media files you upload, such as images, videos, and other content, are saved to the network CDN. Unlike note content, these files are accessible on the network, but the network address of the files is only known to you personally if your relevant documents have not been published on the network. Therefore, please do not place important information in media files or attachments.

Inkdown provides the ability to export your document data and attachments at any time, and you can migrate them to a new platform at any time.

You can choose to delete your account at any time. When you delete your account, we will clean up all your document and file data and it cannot be recovered.
