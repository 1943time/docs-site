Markdown has been popular for many years. Its simple syntax and universal format are the keys to its appeal. Over the years, many excellent Markdown editors have emerged in the industry, and we won’t introduce them all here.

Inkdown is a WYSIWYG Markdown editor that follows the GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec. Let’s first take a look at Inkdown’s user interface:

The interface of Inkdown is very simple because, as the initiator of Inkdown, I am a minimalist. Especially for tool applications, we should avoid excessive unnecessary features and cluttered interfaces.

Although Inkdown is a web-based editor, it uses the browser’s database as a cache, ensuring that the response speed is consistent with that of standalone software, with no noticeable delay. Modern browser databases now have almost the same capacity as hard drive space, so we don’t need to worry about the browser’s ability to store large amounts of files.

Inkdown also uses the browser’s file system to import or export your Markdown documents and image attachments in batches at any time. Inkdown can also support real-time writing in standard Markdown format to the local machine, ensuring users always have a copy of their documents. The famous code editor VSCode’s online version also uses the Chrome file system to interact with local files.

Since modern browsers can solve issues related to running speed and file read/write operations, why not just place the editor directly in the browser? Inkdown believes this is possible. With the help of PWA (Progressive Web App) technology, you can install the web app to your desktop. Inkdown supports offline operation, and when your network is restored, Inkdown will automatically sync the content. In actual use, the experience is almost the same as using desktop software, without the need to download and update. Most editors are based on HTML at their core, and using the browser directly often performs better than embedding it in an app.

Inkdown believes that personal knowledge should be easily shared with others without the need for third-party tools. Inkdown provides a one-click feature to generate document sites that are responsive and can be read on any device, just like the Inkdown documentation, [Inkdown Doc](https://pb.inkdown.me/inkdown/book/docs).

Inkdown is free to use, and if you are not a heavy user, you can continue using it for free. The Inkdown Plus account is also very affordable.
