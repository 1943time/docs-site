You can publish a single document or folder to the Internet with one click. Folders can form a series of documents into a document station, which is very friendly for publishing small e-books.

To isolate notes from published content, When your document changes, you need to click the update button to update the published document. This prevents readers from seeing incomplete content when the document is not edited.

Documents published using Inkdown are responsive and can be displayed well on any device and screen size.

Now let's directly publish the Inkdown introduction document to the internet. You can right-click on the `Getting Start` folder on the left and click on `Publish Folder`

It looks like this on a mobile device:
